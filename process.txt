Process: Am instance of a program (e.g a python interpreter)

+ Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
+ separators memory space -> Memory is not shared Process.
+ Great for CPU-bound processing.
+ New prrocess is stated independenty from other proccesses.
+ Processes are interroptable/killable
+ One GIL for each process -> avoids GIL limitation

- Heavyweight.
- Staring a process is slower than starting a thread.
- More memory.
- IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated.
