GIL: Global interpreter lock 
A lock that allows only one thread at a tim2 to execute in python

- Needed in Cpyhton becausse memory management is not thread-safe . 

-Avoid when:
    - Use multiprocessing .
    - Use a different, free-thread Python implemention (Jython , IronPyhton).
    - Use Python as a wrapper for third-party libraties (C/C++) -> numpy , scipy.
