Threads : An entity within a process that can be scheduled (also Know as "lightweight proccesses")
A process can spawn multiple Threads

+ All threads within a process share the same memory
+ LeightWeight
+ Starting a thread is faster than starting a proccess.
+ Great for I/O- bound tasks

- Threading is limited by GIL : onlu one thread at a time
- No effect for CPU-bound tasks
- Not interruptable / killable
- Careful with race conditions
